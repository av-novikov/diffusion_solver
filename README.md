# diffusion_solver
diffusion_solver is programm tool for numerical calculations of different flow and transport problems of hydrocarbon reservoir simulation.
Single, two and three phase flow considered with linear and non-linear constitutive equations for fluid velocity and properties.
Finite Volume Method is used a as main numerical strategy for discrete system. Direct and iterative linear solvers were employed to address the problem on linear stage.
Output is done in vtk format.

The project was developed under VS C++ compiler.
