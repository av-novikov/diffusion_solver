# diffusion_solver
diffusion_solver is programm tool for numerical calculations of different diffusion problems in reservoir simulation area.
It provides different fluid models (oil, saturated oil, gas) in radial or multi-layers radial cases.
The equation is evaluated with FVM.
Results are availible in vtk formats.

The project is made under VS 2008.
